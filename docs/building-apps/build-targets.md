# Build targets for iOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS and tvOS

The following build targets are defined in .NET for iOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, and tvOS projects.

## Build (Default)

Builds the source code within a project and all dependencies.

## Clean

Removes all files generated by the build process.

## ComputeAvailableDevices

Queries and returns a list of available iOS or tvOS devices and simulators that can be used with `dotnet run`.

This target is called automatically by the .NET SDK's `dotnet run` command to
support device selection via the `--device` option. It returns a `@(Devices)`
item group where each device has the following metadata:

- **Description**: The name of the device (e.g., "iPhone 16 - iOS 26.0" for simulators, "My iPhone 16" for physical devices)
- **Type**: Either "Device" or "Simulator"
- **OSVersion**: The OS version of the device
- **UDID**: The UDID of the device
- **RuntimeIdentifier**: The RuntimeIdentifier of the device

For example, to list all available devices:

```shell
$ dotnet build -t:ComputeAvailableDevices
```

This target is part of the [.NET SDK device selection specification](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/2b9fc02a265c735f2132e4e3626e94962e48bdf5/documentation/specs/dotnet-run-for-maui.md) and enables commands like:

```shell
$ dotnet run --device UDID
```

Added in .NET 11.

## Run

Builds the source code within a project and all dependencies, and then deploys and runs it
on a default simulator/device. A specific deployment target can be set by using the `$(Device)` property. 

```dotnetcli
dotnet build -t:Run project.csproj -p:Device=$(MY_DEVICE_UDID)
```
